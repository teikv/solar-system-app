# 🪐 Solar System 3D App

An immersive and interactive 3D Solar System educational application built with **React** and **Three.js**. This project was developed to help students visualize the scale and movement of our solar system beyond traditional textbooks.


## ✨ Features
- **Interactive 3D Environment:** Zoom, rotate, and explore planets using OrbitControls.
- **Planetary Data Dashboard:** View detailed specs like mass, distance, and atmosphere.
- **Orbit Simulation:** Realistic planetary revolution and rotation animations.
- **Optimized Performance:** Uses Level of Detail (LOD) for smooth 60 FPS rendering.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React.js
- **3D Engine:** [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) (R3F)
- **Utilities:** [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
- **Rendering:** Three.js

## 📦 Project Structure
